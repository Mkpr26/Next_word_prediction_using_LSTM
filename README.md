# Next Word Prediction using LSTM

A neural network model that predicts the next word given a sequence of words, trained on Shakespeare‚Äôs *Hamlet*. The project includes data preprocessing, model training (with and without early stopping), evaluation, and a deployed demo via Streamlit.

## üîç Project Description

This project uses a dataset derived from *Hamlet* (shakespeare text) to build a **Next Word Prediction** model. The model takes as input a sequence of words and learns to predict what word comes next. An LSTM-based architecture is trained on the text, with experiments including early stopping to avoid overfitting. A Streamlit app is provided so users can interactively input text and get predictions for the next word.

Use this app for next word prediction :https://mkpr26-nextword-lstm.streamlit.app/

## ‚úÖ Features

- Data preprocessing: tokenization, sequence generation, padding, vocabulary building  
- Two model versions: basic LSTM model and LSTM with early stopping  
- Saving tokenizer and model weights for reuse  
- Interactive web app for real-time next-word prediction  
- Hyperparameter experiments (sequence length, embedding size, number of LSTM units, etc.)
